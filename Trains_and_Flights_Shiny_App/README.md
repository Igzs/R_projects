# Trains and flights analytics project

This is our final Data Analytics projects, during which we produced a Shiny application displaying aggregated information about SNCF train ride disturbances and US flights data.

## Content of the repo

Content of the different folder of this repo :
* Trains_and_flights : Shiny app with the ui.R and server.R files
* presentation : R presentation with all the necessary content to publish to Rpubs.
* utils : Utility functions and files used during this project
  * working_file.R : File used to test the different queries.
  * split_flights.R : Utility script used to split the large flights csv into a more shinyapps.io friendly file.

## Usage

Start the app using the ui.R and server.R files, or access directly the application by clicking this [link](https://igzs.shinyapps.io/Trains_and_flights/)

Navigate through the different panels using the navigation bar.
Interact with the dashbaord using the ui input.
In the SNCF dahsboard, you can finely tune the departure station by selecting the checkbox.
